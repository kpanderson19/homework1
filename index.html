    <h1>Welcome to Veterinary Solutions!</h1> 
    
    <p>Our company was formed when we realized that Veterinarians across the U.S. were reluctantly selling their businesses so they could save time and get back to being a Vet. After selling, many are disappointed. They've lost control of their practice and what made it uniquely special. Our company wants to solve this dilemma by providing services that takes the pain out of running a business while they also maintain their autonomy and ownership.</p>
